				<h3><a class="linkcolor" name="Home">Home</a></h3>
				The Home is a basic page with a box displaying NPC messages, that are available simply to provide the simulation of a living population.
				The Home also displays all the resources the player currently has.<br />
				<img src="guide/2.png"></img><br />
				In this image, 100 months has passed since the last time the player played. An alert is given to the player alerting them how long they have been away for in in-game time and real-time.

				<h3><a class="linkcolor" name="Map">Map</a></h3>
				The map is where the game is really played and the most important aspect of this game.
				<img src="guide/3.png"></img>
				<div>
					<h4><a class="linkcolor" name="CreateJob">Creating a job</a></h4>
						Every map is randomly generated to provide a different challenge for every player and making every play through different and unique.
						The map is broken up into 10 x 10 sections. Each section has a total of 10 resources which the player can harvest.<br />
						<img src="guide/4.png"></img><br />
						Clicking on a section of the map will display all the available jobs that can be performed in that section of the map and all the resources available to be harvested.
						<br />Note: If a resource is currently being harvested, then the total amount of resources being harvested will be removed from the total resource amount displayed. This
						is intended and is done to prevent harvesting of non-existing resources.<br />
						<img src="guide/5.png"></img><br />
						Clicking on Perform Job option after selecting a job from the dropdown menu will display a pop up box. In the image above, the job being performed is a Harvest
						job, so the pop up that appears is requesting the player to select a resource.<br />
						<img src="guide/6.png"></img><br />
						Expanding view of the dropdown of a possible list of resources from one section.<br />
						<img src="guide/7.png"></img><br />
						After selecting a resource, a new pop up appears. This new pop up displays the job and the resource as the title. In the image above, it is Harvest: Leopard.
						You will be able to allocate a certain amount of workers in this screen and the amount of resources you want to harvest. The amount of workers you allocate
						can be changed later on, but, the amount of resources you want to harvest cannot be changed. The last part of this screen is the time to complete. This allows
						the player to know how long it will take the game to complete in real time.

					<h4><a class="linkcolor" name="Exploration">Exploration</a></h4>
					Exploration allows the player to discover sections of the map that are not yet discovered. This gives players access to more resources and even new
					resources that they do not have access to yet. <br />
					To explore an area, simply click on a greyed out (unexplored) area and a prompt will pop up. The prompt will ask if you want to explore the area.
					An exploration always requires 5 workers, no more no less.<br />
					<img src="guide/10.png"></img><br />
					There are two limitations on exploration. The first limitation is that the is unable to explore the sea until you have obtained any of the boat upgrades.
					The second limitation is that only areas adjacent to areas that are already explored can be explored.<br />

			<div class="section">
				<h3><a class="linkcolor" name="Technology">Technology</a></h3>
				This is where you can purchase certain upgrades. Each upgrade requires a certain resource and a certain amonunt of the resource.
				This page will display the name of the resource, a description of it, the resource and resource amount needed and an upgrade button.<br />
				<img src="guide/8.png"></img><br />
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="section">
				<h3><a class="linkcolor" name="Jobs">Jobs</a></h3>
				This is where a list of every job that the player is performing is displayed. It displays each jobs name, progression rate, the amount of workers assigned, an
				assign button and an end button.<br />
				The assign button will display a pop up, similiar to the second pop up that is displayed when creating a job. The player can add workers to the job to speed it up or
				remove workers from the job.<br />
				The end button is to end a job prematurely. When a job is ended prematurely, the player will gain resources equal to the percentage that the job has progressed.<br />
